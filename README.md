# ossatrisk

**ossatrisk** surfaces widely-used open source packages with hidden risks, like abandoned maintenance, unpatched CVEs, or a single-maintainer bus factor.

Only packages with high impact and broad usage are flagged.

The goal is not to name and shame, but to understand the ecosystem and suggest remediation—contacting maintainers, contributing fixes, or forking when needed.

Starting with the **PHP ecosystem**. More ecosystems planned.
